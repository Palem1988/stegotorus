/* Packets on the wire have a 16-byte header, consisting of a 32-bit
   sequence number, two 16-bit length fields ("D" and "P"), an 8-bit
   opcode ("F"), an 8-bit retransmit count ("R"), and a 48-bit check
   field.  All numbers in this header are serialized in network byte
   order.

   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |
   |Sequence Number|   D   |   P   | F | R |       Check           |

   The header is encrypted with AES in ECB mode: this is safe because
   the header is exactly one AES block long, the sequence number +
   retransmit count is never repeated, the header-encryption key is
   not used for anything else, and the high 24 bits of the sequence
   number, plus the check field, constitute an 72-bit MAC.  The
   receiver maintains a 256-element sliding window of acceptable
   sequence numbers, which begins one after the highest sequence
   number so far _processed_ (not received).  If the sequence number
   is outside this window, or the check field is not all-bits-zero,
   the packet is discarded.  An attacker's odds of being able to
   manipulate the D, P, F, or R fields or the low bits of the sequence
   number are therefore less than one in 2^72.  (This is weak compared
   to our default security parameter of 2^128, but should be sufficient
   for the protection of this small amount of data.)

   Unlike TCP, our sequence numbers always start at zero on a new (or
   freshly rekeyed) circuit, and increment by one per _block_, not per
   byte of data.  Furthermore, they do not wrap: a rekeying cycle
   (which resets the sequence number) is required to occur before the
   highest-received sequence number reaches 2^32.

   Following the header are two variable-length payload sections,
   "data" and "padding", whose length in bytes are given by the D and
   P fields, respectively.  These sections are encrypted, using a
   different key, with AES in GCM mode.  The *encrypted* packet header
   doubles as the GCM nonce.  The semantics of the "data" section's
   contents, if any, are defined by the opcode F.  The "padding"
   section SHOULD be filled with zeroes by the sender; regardless, its
   contents MUST be ignored by the receiver.  Following these sections
   is a 16-byte GCM authentication tag, computed over the data and
   padding sections only, NOT the message header.  */
